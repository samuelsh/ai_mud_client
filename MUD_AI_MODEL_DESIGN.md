# MUD AI Model Design Document
## Custom DistilBERT-based Model for MUD Interactions

### Overview
This document outlines the design for training a custom AI model specifically for MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) interactions using PyTorch and DistilBERT as the base architecture.

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Cost**: OpenAI API calls are expensive for continuous MUD interactions
- **Latency**: Network calls to external APIs introduce delays
- **Privacy**: Game data sent to third-party services
- **Generic Responses**: Models not specifically trained for MUD interactions
- **Rate Limits**: API quotas limit continuous gameplay

### Target Benefits
- **Cost-Effective**: One-time training, free inference
- **Low Latency**: Local inference eliminates network delays
- **Privacy**: All data stays local
- **Specialized**: Model trained specifically for MUD patterns
- **Unlimited Usage**: No rate limits or quotas

## 2. Architecture Design

### Base Model: DistilBERT
```
DistilBERT (66M parameters) → Custom Head → MUD Command Output
```

**Why DistilBERT?**
- **Efficiency**: 40% smaller than BERT, 60% faster
- **Performance**: Maintains 97% of BERT's performance
- **Resource-Friendly**: Suitable for local deployment
- **Proven**: Widely used for text classification and generation

### Model Architecture
```
Input: [CLS] Game Context [SEP] Server Response [SEP]
       ↓
DistilBERT Encoder (6 layers, 768 hidden size)
       ↓
Pooled Output (768 dimensions)
       ↓
Custom Classification Head
       ↓
Output: Command Classification + Confidence
```

## 3. Data Collection Strategy

### Training Data Sources

#### A. Synthetic Data Generation
```python
# Example training pairs
{
    "input": "You are in a dark room. Exits: north, south. What do you do?",
    "output": "look",
    "context": "exploring"
},
{
    "input": "A troll attacks you! Your health is low. What do you do?",
    "output": "flee",
    "context": "combat"
}
```

#### B. Real MUD Data Collection
- **Log Parsing**: Extract command-response pairs from existing MUD logs
- **Player Sessions**: Record successful player interactions
- **Server Responses**: Catalog common server message patterns
- **Command Patterns**: Identify successful command sequences

#### C. Data Augmentation
- **Command Variations**: "north", "go north", "move north"
- **Context Variations**: Different room descriptions, health states
- **Response Variations**: Multiple valid responses to same situation

### Data Structure
```json
{
    "game_context": {
        "location": "Dark Forest",
        "health": 75,
        "game_state": "exploring",
        "last_command": "look"
    },
    "server_response": "You see a path leading north. A troll blocks the way south.",
    "valid_commands": ["north", "south", "look", "examine troll"],
    "chosen_command": "look",
    "success": true
}
```

## 4. Model Training Strategy

### Training Phases

#### Phase 1: Pre-training (Optional)
- **Task**: Masked Language Modeling on MUD text corpus
- **Data**: Large collection of MUD logs, descriptions, commands
- **Goal**: Learn MUD-specific language patterns

#### Phase 2: Fine-tuning
- **Task**: Command classification/sequence-to-sequence
- **Data**: Annotated command-response pairs
- **Goal**: Learn to generate appropriate commands

#### Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning (Future)
- **Task**: Learn from gameplay outcomes
- **Data**: Successful vs failed command sequences
- **Goal**: Optimize for long-term success
